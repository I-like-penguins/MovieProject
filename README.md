# What to expect
This is a project for Masterschool. Basically you get a sqlite DB with different movies, specified by  a user, using omdb API. Afterward you can generate a website of this database, with movie posters.

# Requirements
Needs SQLalchemy, dotenv, requests and some json

# Notes
Since the task before was to build a movie database using json and one had to copy files from there there is still some leftover code.
In some places old code was just commented out and may need some attention.
